# Creating CodeQL Custom Query Packs with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

## Overview

This guide explains how to leverage GitHub Copilot coding agents to create custom CodeQL query packs for security analysis. Learn how to effectively collaborate with AI assistants to build enterprise-grade static analysis solutions.

## Introduction to CodeQL + AI Development

### What is CodeQL?
CodeQL is GitHub's semantic analysis engine that treats code as queryable data. It enables precise vulnerability detection through:
- **AST Analysis**: Understanding code structure and relationships
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Tracking data movement through applications
- **Taint Tracking**: Following untrusted input to dangerous operations
- **Control Flow Analysis**: Understanding execution paths and conditions

### Benefits of AI-Assisted CodeQL Development
- **Accelerated Learning**: AI explains complex query logic and APIs
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies common vulnerability patterns
- **Code Generation**: AI creates boilerplate and complex query structures
- **Debugging Support**: AI helps diagnose compilation and logic errors
- **Best Practices**: AI suggests enterprise-grade implementation approaches

## Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering

### Step 1: Define Security Objectives
Work with your coding agent to clarify:
```markdown
**Example Interaction:**
You: "I need to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in Python Django applications"

Agent Response:
- Analyzes Django ORM patterns
- Identifies raw SQL usage patterns
- Maps common source/sink relationships
- Suggests query scope and accuracy targets
```

### Step 2: Identify Target Languages and Frameworks
**Prompt Template:**
```
