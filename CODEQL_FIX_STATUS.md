## CodeQL Fix Status

This branch (CodeQL-email-header) contains the fixed EmailHeaderInjection.ql query.

The query has been updated to be compatible with CodeQL 2.23.0:

1. Replaced deprecated `TaintTracking::Configuration` with `DataFlow::ConfigSig` module pattern
2. Updated to use `DataFlow::parameterNode()` instead of deprecated functions  
3. Simplified API usage to use basic AST patterns instead of complex ApiGraphs
4. Fixed all compilation errors identified in the failing workflow run

## Next Steps

Push this branch to origin to trigger the CodeQL workflow:
```bash
git push origin CodeQL-email-header
```

The workflow should now pass without compilation errors.
